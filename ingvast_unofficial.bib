	A genetic algorithms have been used to find the Pareto front of two
	objective variables for a passive variable transmission (PVT).
	Constraints was the PVT's ability to amplify torque and the stiffness of
	the output shaft. The velocity ratio between the input and the output
	shaft at no load and the torque rise time was used as the objective
	functions. Five physical properties; two radii, the wire length, an
	angle and two spring properties was used as design variables. 
	--
	The ideas behind NSGA-II [Deb:2000:AFE] was used for the main algorithm.
	Two thousand generations were evaluated with a population of 500
	individuals. Altogether about 250 thousand function evaluations were
	made. The evolved Pareto front was not as continuous as expected but the
	main relation was visible. The minimum velocity ratio found was about
	0.9 (with the torque amplification or torque ratio three) and the
	minimum rise time found was about 0.15 s.
	--
	For comparison, a raw computation on the meshed variable space was made.
	About 700 thousand points were evaluated. However, not at any point did
	that result become better than the result from the genetic algorithm
	search.

	abstract ={
		This article investigates some of the issues found in
		litterature useful when building a low cost underactuated hand,
		either a robot hand or a prosthesis hand.

		The movements of underactuated fingers can by definition not be
		controlled precisely as a fully actuated finger.  Therefore the
		machanics has to be designed in a way that support grasping
		without explicit control.  The design of such a finger is a
		challenging task, and if designed poorly, the finger might not
		be useful at some situations.  The article describes som
		econcepts of finger design as well as some of the pitfalls.

		Underactuated hands have the possibility to be low cost, not
		only because of few actuators, but also because less sensor
		information is needed.  Furthermore, the design does not have to
		be as precise, as for fully actuated hands.  Therefore, new
		approaches of finger hardware are possible.

  		 an approach for making a quadruped robot trot and walk},

  abstract =	{
  This paper presents a way of making a robot walk and trot with a continuous
  transition in between. The main parts are a trunk motion planner, a planner
  for the footholds and a robot center of mass estimator. The instantaneous
  trunk path is a summation of weighted positions of the feet in contact with
  the ground. The weights are a function of time and can be planned ahead. If at
  least three of the weight functions are non-zero (and positive) and they are
  continuous in time, the resulting path is statically stable and continuous.
  When only two are non-zero, the path is not statically stable but the path
  will still be continuous, thus possible to use for trot. 
       The overall walking direction is given by the footholds which are planned
  with the feet in contact with the ground as a reference, not the trunk.  Since
  both the foothold planner and the trunk motion planner use the feet position
  as reference one can say that the trunk follows the feet, hence the title.
       In the trotting gait, when only two feet are on the ground, the behaviour
  of the motion is very sensitive to the position of the center of mass.
  Therefore a center of mass estimation is implemented which only uses ground
  contact switches on the feet as feedback. 
       Transitions between crawl and trot are demonstrated in experiments using
  the quadruped robot Warp1.
