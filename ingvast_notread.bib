	Walking robots are difficult to control. To aid in the design
	of controllers, simulations can be used for tests and
	evaluation. Envision is a commercial simulation program that
	has been acquired by the Mechatronics Lab (DAMEK) at KTH. It's
	originally designed to simulate industrial robots and space
	applications. The purpose of this master's thesis is to study
	the possibilities to enhance the functionality of Envision so
	that it is possible to simulate a walking robot. The result
	was that simulation of a walking robot only required that a
	model of the ground was added to Envision. After studies of
	different ground models, a decision to implement a spring and
	damper model was taken. The spring and damper model allows for
	simulation of difficult terrain, including slippage due to low

	the conclusions is that Envision can be used to simulate a

    This research deals with the development of a load-sensitive continuously

    systems that make it especially suitable for use as a robotic actuator.
    X-screw has a transmission ratio that automatically changes in response to
    the load, making it possible to combine relatively high speed motion under
    low loads with a large maximum load capacity in a much smaller space and
    with less complexity, than traditional transmission systems. X-screw also
    has built-in overload protection since it will stop advancing if the load
    exceeds a certain value although the motor is able to continue to rotate.
    Furthermore, X-screw can produce arbitrarily slow linear motion from a high
    speed input, eliminating the need for bulky gear reductions. Experimental
    tests conducted with a prototype have confirmed the functionality of this
    system.

  abstract = {
    To make galloping available as a high-speed gait of quadrupedal robots, this
    dissertation addresses the mechanics of galloping and the design of legged
    robots for rapid locomotion.  A simple method of measuring an animals
    geometric and inertial properties is used to develop reasonable model
    parameters for the animal. An impulsive model of galloping is extended to
    all dynamic quadrupedal gaits to show that with equal stride frequencies,
    galloping requires smaller vertical oscillations of the mass center than
    trotting does at high speeds. In contrast, spring-mass models of both gaits
    indicate that trotting is accomplished with smaller vertical oscillations
    and/or lower stride frequencies at lower speeds. In conjunction, these two
    results suggest that animals transition from a trot to a gallop in order to
    minimize their stride frequencies without experiencing large vertical
    displacements.
    For a quadruped robot to gallop in an energy-efficient manner, it must be
    designed to exhibit this same behavior at high speeds. The generalized
    inertia ellipsoid is presented as visualization tool for comparing leg
    designs in terms of impact losses and energy required for leg return.
    Kinetostatic analysis of effective stiffness is introduced as a means of
    establishing leg geometry in order to match the leg stiffness of animals.
    This method is implemented in the design of an articulated, prototype leg
    which stores elastic energy in mechanical extension springs during its
    return phase and releases that energy as thrust during stance. Experimental
    results with this leg indicate that it has the performance capabilities to
    be used in a quadruped galloping machine.

      For both historical and technological reasons, most robots, including
      those meant to mimic animals or operate in natural environments,3 use
      actuators and control systems that have high (stiff) mechanical impedance.
      By contrast, most animals exhibit low (soft) impedance. While a robot's
      stiff joints may be programmed to closely imitate the recorded motion of
      an animal's soft joints, any unexpected position disturbances will
      generate reactive forces and torques much higher for the robot than for
      the animal. The dual of this is also true: while an animal will react to a
      force disturbance by significantly yielding position, a typical robot will
      greatly resist.

      These differences cause three deleterious effects for high impedance
      robots. First, the higher forces may cause damage to the robot or to its
      environment (which is particularly important if that environment includes
      people). Second, the robot must acquire very precise information about its
      position relative to the environment so as to minimize its velocity upon
      impact. Third, many of the self-stabilizing effects of natural dynamics
      are \u201cshorted out\u201d4 by the robot's high impedance, so that
      stabilization requires more effort from the control system.

      Over the past 5 yr, our laboratory has designed a series of walking robots
      based on \u201cSeries-Elastic Actuators\u201d and \u201cVirtual Model
      Control.\u201d Using these two techniques, we have been able to build
      low-impedance walking robots that are both safe and robust, that operate
      blindly without any model of upcoming terrain, and that add minimal
      control effort in parallel to their self-stabilizing passive dynamics. We
      have discovered that it is possible to achieve surprisingly effective
      ambulation from rather simple mechanisms and control systems. After
      describing the historical and technological motivations for our approach,
      this paper gives an overview of our methods and shows some of the results
      we have obtained.
