	This article presents a standing posture controller for
	quadruped robots, i.e. control of the trunk's desired roll
	angle, pitch angle and height.  The controller is based on a
	few simple ideas: 1) control the legs using force control
	vertically and position control horizontally forces; 2) Use
	simple heuristic rules for how to distribute leg forces; 3)
	The supporting surface should not have to be horizontal,
	planar or even static; 4) The height is not easily defined for
	a legged robot, use the average of the "leg heights"
	This controller is successfully tested in both simulation and
	experiments.  One of the results was that this type of
	controller can be sensitive to static friction in the
	joints. A simple friction compensation was used to compensate
	for this problem. Finally, we suggest a test to benchmark
	standing posture controllers for legged robots.},

    This report investigates the passively variable transmission (PVT).
    When the PVT is used with an motor the output shaft can be fast at low
    loads and strong at high loads.  Pulleys, wires and springs comprises
    the PVT and in the report these parts are considered lossless.
    Therefore, the PVT is classified as a conservative system.  This
    classification is then used to derive relations and properties that
    characterize the transmission. For conventional transmissions, the
    transmission ratio relates the input torque to the output torque and
    also the input angular velocity to the output angular velocity.
    However, for compliant transmission such as PVT, the relation between
    the angular velocities is not well defined. Instead of transmission
    ratio, the concepts of torque ratio and the velocity ratio are
    introduced. The latter is the relation of the input and output angular
    velocities when the output torque is constant. The velocity ratio is
    generally not equal to the torque ratio. One of the results of the
    theory chapter is that the torque ratio has to be smaller than the
    velocity ratio in order for the torque ratio to increase when the
    torque increases.

    A model of the PVT is built and the properties examined. Further, two
    other compliant transmissions with similar properties are modeled and
    examined. 
       
    A prototype of the PVT driven by a DC-motor is presented.  Attempts to
    control the force, velocity and position of the transmission are made.
    The force control in open loop was examined and compared to closed
    loop. Noise from the torque measurements results in large control
    signals when the loop was closed in combination with low torque.
    Controlling the torque to zero results in small errors even when the
    output shaft moves fast and irregularly. A drawback with the internal
    compliance is that the controller handles fast reference changes
    poorly, mainly because of motor saturation. Because of the
    nonlinearities, this is more severe at low loads than high loads. Two
    velocity controllers are developed, one linear and one based on
    feedback linearization. Only the linear is verified in experiments.
    Performance was illustrated at low loads and also how the performance
    deteriorate when the demands becomes large. For position control,
    feedback linearization was used and the controller was verified for
    low and high inertial load. Again, saturation of the motor limits the
    performance.
  
    The result of the control experiments are mainly that in order to
    utilize the full potential of the PVT for velocity and position
    control, some other control algorithm should be used in order to: 1)
    Minimize the influence of noisy torque measurements.  2) Guarantee
    stability of the system when the motor is working under saturation.

	  The research presented in this thesis regards walking of quadruped
	  robots, and particularly the walking of the Warp1 robot.  The
	  motivation for the robot is to provide a platform for autonomous
	  walking in rough terrain.

	  The thesis contains six papers ranging from development tools to
	  actuation of robot legs.  The first paper describes the methods and
	  tools made for control development.  These tools feature: programming
	  of the robot without low level coding (C-code); that the controller
	  has to be built only once for simulation and experiments; and that
	  names of variables and constants are unchanged through the chain of
	  software Maple -- Matlab -- Simulink{} -- Real Time Workshop --
	  xPC--Target.

	  Three controllers, each making the robot walk are presented. The first
	  controller makes the robot walk using the crawl gait. The method uses
	  static stability as method for keeping balance and the instantaneous
	  trunk motions are given by a concept using the so called
	  weight-ratios.  A method for planning new footholds based on the
	  positions of the existing footholds is also proposed and the
	  controller experimentally verified.

	  The second walking controller shows that the robot also can walk
	  dynamically using the trot gait. The method proposed uses information
	  from ground contact sensors on the feet as input to control balance,
	  instead of, which is common, inertial sensors. It is experimentally
	  verified that Warp1 can trot from level ground onto a slope and turn
	  around while staying balanced.

	  The main ideas of these two walking controllers are fused in the third
	  which enables smooth transitions between crawl and trot. The idea of
	  using the ground contact sensors from the first controller is here
	  used to estimate the position of the center of mass.  This controller
	  uses weight-ratios in the gait crawl as well as in the dynamic gait
	  trot.  Hence, the method of using weight-ratios is not only useful for
	  static stability for which it was originally intended. The controller
	  is experimentally verified on Warp1.

	  The Warp1 robot weighs about 60 kg, has 0.6 m long legs with three
	  actuated joints on each.  The speed and strength is sufficient only
	  for slow walking, even though the installed power indicates that it
	  should be enough for faster walking.  The reason is that a walking
	  robot often needs to be strong but slow when the feet are on the
	  ground and the opposite when in the air. This can not be achieved with
	  the motors and transmissions currently used. 

	  A transmission called the passively variable transmission (PVT) is
	  proposed which enhance motor capabilities of robot joints. It is
	  elastic, nonlinear and conservative.  Some general properties for
	  elastic transmissions are derived such that they can be compared with
	  conventional transmissions.  The PVT gives strong actuation at large
	  loads and fast actuation at small loads.  The proposed transmission is
	  compared to a conventional transmission for a specific task, and the
	  result is that a smaller motor can be used.

  This paper presents an innovative transmission called the
  passively variable transmission (PVT) that has a high torque ratio for large
  loads and a low velocity   ratio for small loads. The change in these ratios
  depends passively on the load, in contrast to the continuous variable
  transmission (CVT), where the transmission ratio   is controlled explicitly.
  Another difference from the CVT is that the PVT is elastic and the term
  transmission ratio is therefore not applicable. A theory section  formulates
  alternative ways of describing the torque and velocity relations for elastic
  conservative transmisions as well as other important properties.
  
  This theory is used to analyze and illustrate the characteristics of a PVT.
  The theory is also used to compare the PVT with another novel elastic
  conservative transmission, called load sensitive CVT.
  
  The nonlinearities and elasticity of the PVT make it difficult to control
  using linear control theory. Feedback linearization was therefore used to
  design a torque controller, and experimental results show low impedance at
  small loads. Further, the controller tracks a reference torque well as long as
  the reference rate does not cause motor saturation. The abilities of the PVT
  are also illustrated by comparing it with an actuator having a traditional
  transmission. The load case is recorded joint torques and angles from the
  carpus joint of a walking horse. Simulation show that the required peak power
  is reduced by more than 20\% and the product of the maximum torque and the
  maximum angular velocity is reduced by approximately 30\%.},
