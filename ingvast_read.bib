	Previous studies have noted that biological quadrupeds adjust
	their gaits when encountering drag in their locomotion. This
	paper investigates the hypothesis that these gait adjustments
	allow the legs to operate atan optimal working length when
	generating thrust. A 5-DoF dynamic model of a quadruped having
	a rigid trunk and massless leg is formulated. This model
	reflects the dimensions and inertial properties of a galloping
	machine that theauthors are designing. The constrained
	steady-state motion equations governing the transvere and
	rotary gallops of the model are solved numerically for various
	leelsof drag. The footfall phasing solutions for both forms of
	the gallop approach a partially in-phase gait,the half-bound,
	as drag increases. These gait transitions are the result of
	constraints requiring the legs to operate at their optimal
	working length when in contact with the terrain. Thus, the
	behavios of the model supports the original hypothesis. This
	paper also includes a discussion of future research directions
	in the field of artificial legged locomotion.},
  annote =	 {
	They assume massless articulated legs and model the
	environmental interaction through impulses. By formulating a
	set of constraint equations, they can then solve for a steady
	state gait as a function of drag (i.e. resistance from going
	uphill). The variables they solve for include footfall times,
	locomotion period and pose (attitude) at the beginning of a
	cycle.

	They assume that the impulses pass through the hip joints, I'm
	not sure I totally agree with that assumption. The lateral
	components of the impulses are also neglected (assumed zero).

	I like this approach since it greatly reduces the search
	space, by searching for impulses instead of forces as a
	function of time.

	ToDo: Check impulses from my simulation results and see if it fits.

	Idea. It might be possible to use this kind of search to more
	easily find gaits (different footfall sequences?). Even though
	it might be necessary to add a step where the impulses are
	converted to force, this can still save time.},

	The evolution of legged vehicles has progressed significanlty

	kinematic limits of individual legs, leads to the development
	of schmese for automatic body regulation. the automatic body

  This paper devoted to the performance of the concept of Zero-Moment Point,
  widely-known by the acronym ZMP.  Thirty-five years have elapsed since its
  implicit presentation (actually before being named ZMP) to the scientific
  community and thirty-three years since it was explicitly introduced and
  clearly elaborated, initially in the leading journals published in English.
  Its first practical domonstration took place in Japan in 1984, at Waseda
  University, Laboratory of Ichiro Kato, in the first dynamically balanced robot
  {WL-10RD} of the robotic family {WABOT}. The paper gives an in-depth
  discussion of source results concerning ZMP, paying particular attention to
  some delicate issues that may lead to confusion if this method is applied in a
  mechanistic manner onto irregular cases of artificial gait, i.e.  in the case
  of loss of dynamic balance of a humanoid robot.
  
  After a short survey of the history of the origin of ZMP a very detailed
  elaboration of ZMP notion is given, with a special review concerning "boundary
  cases" when the ZMP is close to the edge of the support polygon and "fictious
  cases" when the ZMP should be outside the support polygon.  In addition, the
  difference between ZMP and the center of pressure is pointed out.  Finally,
  some unresolved or insufficiently treated phenomena that may yield a
  significant improvement in robot performance are considered.

	The bow leg hopper is a new design for a locomoting system

	The bow leg hopper is a novel locomotor design with a highly
	resilient leg that resembles an archer's bow. During flight, a
	"thurst" actuator adds elastic energy to the leg, which is
	automatically released during stance to control hopping
	height. Lateral motion is controlled by directing the leg
	angle at touchdown, which determines the angle of takeof or
	reflection. The leg pivots freely on a hip bearing and is
	automatically decoupled from the leg-angle positioner during
	stance to preclude hip torques that would disturb boyd
	attitude. Upright attitude is maintained without active
	control by allowing the body to "hang" from the hip
	joint. Preliminary experiments with a planar protoype have

    To calculate normative joint moments of force and power for the forelimb of
    walking horses as a benchmark against which to compare these mechanical
    variables in horses with specific lameness. ANIMALS: 4 Dutch Warmblood
    horses with no recent history of lameness. PROCEDURE: Horses were walked by
    hand through the test area, and data from 5 walking trials were collected
    for each horse. Two camera views were combined with vertical and
    craniocaudal ground reaction forces to calculate net moments of force in the
    sagittal plane across the carpal, metacarpophalangeal (fetlock), and distal
    interphalangeal (coffin) joints during the stance phase of the forelimb.
    Mechanical power was calculated as the product of net joint moment and the
    joint's angular velocity. RESULTS: During the early part of the stance
    phase, the carpal joint had oscillating periods of energy generation and
    absorption against a predominant flexor moment, then an absorption phase at
    the end of the stance phase, as the carpus flexed into swing against an
    extensor moment. The fetlock absorbed energy in the early part of the stance
    phase, then the terminal part was marked by a large generation of energy
    across the joint. A flexor moment was measured at the coffin joint
    throughout the stance phase, and this coincided with a long phase of energy
    absorption followed by a short phase of generation for push-off. CONCLUSION:
    Consistency of the power data indicates that typical profiles of work exist
    for each of the joints (carpus, fetlock, and coffin). CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
    Detection of changes to these profiles of work may contribute to diagnosis
    of specific lameness conditions.

	Most robot designers make the mechanical interface between an

	in traditional position-controlled systems, because high

	contact with hard surfaces is well known. This paper proposes
	that for natural tasks where small-motion bandwidth is not of

	significantly less stiff than in most present
	designs. Furthermore, by purposefully placing the majority of
	interface elasticity inside of an acutator package, a new type

	This work contributes to the stabilization problem of cascaded nonlinear
	systems by means of bounded control. The systems in consideration are
	assumed to be in feedforward form, i.e. they consist of the cascade of
	an asymptotically stable system driving a upper system, which is assumed
	to have no exponentially unstable behaviour. Such systems are
	stabilizable with forwarding, which is a constructive method for
	obtaining stabilizing feedbacks, that strongly depends on the
	solvability of a partial dierential equation. A related result on
	forwarding, that relaxes this limitation, is presented. For the main
	results of the thesis we start o with the non-standard assumption that
	the lower subsystem of the cascade in consideration is input to state
	stable. This allows to assume that the state of the lower subsystem is
	driven in finite time in a small neighbourhood of the origin provided
	the control input is kept small enough. Therein results from linear
	control theory, and in particular the bounded real lemma inequality, are
	used to design a bounded, partial state feedback stabilizing law. Global
	asymptotic stability of the closed loop system is then proven by means
	of a generalization of the small gain theorem. Within this framework,
	results on the asymptotic stabilization with bounded controls of
	constant sign and on the practical stabilization with quantized controls
	are also discussed. In addition, a novel dynamic controller has been
	presented for the problem of output feedback asymptotic stabilization of
	linear systems, in the case of saturated measurements. The main results
	are used to design a novel saturated feedback scheme for the
	stabilization of a chain of integrators, while other benchmark
	applications have been studied and new solutions have been presented.
	Finally, a discussion on the geometric conditions governing systems that
	are equivalent to feedforward forms completes the thesis.

  abstract ={
	This paper discusses an algorithm to make a quadruped machine
	walk dynamically and omnidirectionally following a real-time
	command from an operator. To produce a smooth body motion at
	high speed locomotion, we introduced a new gait, named the
	'intermittent trot gait', in which a four-leg-supporting phase
	and a two-diagonal-leg-supporting phase appear in orders. In
	this gait, the pitching and rolling motion of the body is
	suppressed to a lower level than that of the other gaits
	because the dynamic effects of the swinging legs almost cancel
	each other. To realize the intermittent trot gait, new
	algorithms to plan a landing point and body motion are
	discussed. A landing point is decided by considering an
	operator command and conversion to the standard leg
	formation. A body motion is planned to produce dynamic

	To realize dynamically stable walking for a quadruped walking
	robot, the combination of the trajectory planning of the body
	and leg position (feedforward control) and the adaptive
	attitude control using sensory information (feedback control)
	is indispensable. In this paper, we initially propose a new
	trajectory planning for the stable trot gait named 3D sway
	compenstaion trajectory planning for the stable trot gait
	named 3D sway compensation trajectory, and show that this
	trajectory has lower energy consumption than the conventional
	sway trajectory that the authors have proposed. Next, as the
	adaptive attitude control method used during the 2-leg
	supporting phase of the trot gait, we consider four methods:
	a) rotation of body along the diagonal line between supporting
	feet, b) translation of body along the perpendicular line
	between supporting feet, c) vertical swing motion of
	recovereing legs, and d) horizontal swing motion of
	rrecovereing legs. The stabilization efficiency of each method
	is verified through computer simulation and the damping
	experiment using a quadruped walking robot,
	TITAN-VIII. Furthermore, the trot gati control that combines
	the feedforward control based on the proposed 3D sway
	compenstation trajectory and the adaptive feedback control
	using body translation and vertical motion of swing legs is
	developed, and the walking experiment on rough terrain using
	TITAN-VIII is carried out.},

  	Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms which use non-dominated sorting

	$\mathcal O (MN^3)$ computational complexity (where M is the number of

	(iii) the need for specifying a sharing parameter.  In this paper we
	suggest a non-dominated sorting based multi-objective evolutionary

	which alleviates all the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast
	non-dominated sorting approach with $\mathcal O (MN^2)$ computational
	complexity is presented.  Second, a selection operator is presented
	which creates a mating pool by combining the parent and child
	populations and selecting the best (with respect to fitness and spread)
	$N$ solutions.  Simulation results on a number of difficult test
	problems show that the proposed {NSGA-II}, in most problems, is able to
	find much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the
	true Pareto-optimal front compared to PAES and SPEA -- two other
	elitiset multi-objective EAs which pay special attention towards
	creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front.  Moreover, we modify the
	definition of dominace in order to solve constrained multi-objective
	problems efficiently.  Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on
	a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint
	non-linear problem are compared with another constrained multi-objective
	optimizer and much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.  Because
	of NSGA-II's low computational requirements, elitist approach,
	parameter-less niching approach, and simple constraint-handling

	increase in allowed compressor exit temperature also gives a reduction
	int the exhaust gas temperature.  The nozzle area increases, however.

	Still, the temperature reduction outweights the increases in nozzle.

  We provide a formula for a stabilizing feedback law using a
  bounded control, under the assumption that an appropriate control-Lyapunov
  function is known. Such a feedback, smooth away from the origin and continuous
  everywhere, is known to exist via Artstein's Theorem. As in the
  unbounded-control case treated in a previous note, we provide an explicit and
  \universal" formula given by an algebraic function of Lie derivatives. In
  particular, we extend to the bounded case the result that the feedback can be
  chosen analytic if the Lyapunov function and the vector  elds de ning the

  X-screw, a load-sensitive linear actuator that we have proposed, has many
  desirable characteristics, but one drawback is that the linear motion is much
  slower than a conventional lead screw because of the method X-screw uses to
  produce linear motion. When the axial load is small, the transmission
  efficiency of X-screw is approximately the same as that of a lead screw since
  the transmitted power is low in this case. Therefore we have developed a dual
  mode version of X-screw called "DM X-screw". This mechanism is able to
  automatically switch between lead screw mode and X-screw mode in response to
  the axial load. This feature makes it possible to apply DM X-screw to many
  mechanical systems. We have used this mechanism in a pantograph jack that
  makes use of its dual mode load-sensitive variable transmission properties.
  This jack can be operated with a small input force and unlike conventional
  jacks, several of these jacks can be used in combination to overcome the
  output force limitations of normal pantograph jacks

      Walking robots can be divided into two categories: on one hand the fully
      actuated robots that don't use passive dynamics, and on the other hand the
      energy efficient passive walkers. For autonomous robots the energy storage
      is a problem, forecasting a bright future for passive walkers. At this
      moment the passive walkers are restricted to one walking speed due to the
      eigenfrequency, which is fixed by the mechanical constructions.  Several
      actuators with adaptable compliant have been designed, but due to size,
      complexity or controllability these are difficult to implement in bipeds.

      Another application of the use of adaptable compliance is safe robot-
      human interaction. Sometimes a robot has to be stiff, e.g. for pick and
      place operations, but when moving between humans, a robot is preferably
      compliant. Also for exoskeletons or rehabilitation devices this compliance
      can improve ergonomics and speed up the rehabilitation process.
      
      The MACCEPA is a straightforward and easy to construct rotational
      actuator, of which the compliance can be controlled separately from the
      equilibrium position. The generated torque is a linear function of the
      compliance and of the angle between equilibrium position and actual
      position. This makes this actuator perfectly suitable for dynamic walking,
      human-robotic interfaces and robotic rehabilitation devices.

  abstract = {
    There are robotic applications in which the human user works in direct
    physical contact with the robot.  Examples include surgical robotics, haptic
    display, and trajectory enhancing systems. Because safety and stability are
    of major concern in these systems, passive robots, which are intrinsically
    safe and stable, are attractive solutions. A cobot is a new type of passive
    robotic device created for use in these applications.  Cobots have no joint
    actuators. Instead, they employ nonholonomic joints that redirect
    undesirable user motions rather than fight them.  The scope of this thesis
    is the creation and study of a nonholonomic joint called a continuously
    variable transmission (CVT). The CVT will be used to create cobots with
    serial link architectures. A cobot with n links uses n-1 CVTs to couple the
    rotations of each consecutive pair of joints. Each CVT is computer
    controlled to set the angular velocity ratio of the two joints that are
    coupled to it. With all the cobots joints set to rotate in a particular
    ratio, its end point is constrained to a particular trajectory through
    space.  Cobots aid the user in task completion by providing virtual
    constraint surfaces that guide the userÕs motion. For example, a cobot could
    be used to constrain the motion of a surgeonÕs cutting tool to a trajectory
    that was programmed pre-operatively. Or as part of a haptic display system,
    a cobot could provide virtual walls for a person pushing on its end
    effector.  When a force on a cobotÕs end effector is applied perpendicular
    to a constraint surface, torques are created in the cobotÕs joints. These
    torques produce joint angular velocity error causing the end effector to
    leave the desired path and penetrate the constraint surface. At some value
    of applied force, the torques become too great, and the constraint surface
    is catastrophically violated.  In this thesis, a model of the friction
    forces that support joint torques is developed. From the model, equations
    are derived to relate joint angular velocity error to joint torque
    magnitude. The maximum sustainable joint torques are also calculated. I find
    that the relationship between joint angular velocity error and joint torque
    is a function of the angular velocity ratio of the joints.  Experiments have
    been done to test the friction model and to yield additional information on
    CVT dynamics and resulting cobot performance.  The results are used to
    determine what design changes can engender the creation of robust
    constraints.  }

	This thesis is about control and balance stability of legged
	locomotion. It also presents a combination of tools that makes it
	easier to design controllers for large and complicated robot
	systems. The thesis is divided into four parts.

	The first part studies and analyzes how walking machines are
	controlled, examining the literature of over twenty machines
	briefly, and six machines in detail. The goal is to understand how
	the controllers work on a level below task and path planning, but
	above actuator control. Analysis and comparison is done in terms of:
	i) generation of trunk motion; ii) maintaining balance; iii)
	generation of leg sequence and support patterns; and iv) reflexes.

	The next part describes Warp1, a four-legged walking robot platform
	that has been built with the long term goal of walking in rough
	terrain. First its modular structure (mechanics, electronics and
	control) is described, followed by some experiments demonstrating
	basic performance. Finally the mathematical modeling of the robot's
	rigid body model is described. This model is derived symbolically
	and is general, i.e. not restricted to Warp1. It is easily modified
	in case of a different number of legs or joints.

	During the work with Warp1, tools for model derivation, control
	design and control implementation have been combined, interfaced and
	augmented in order to better support design and analysis. These
	tools and methods are described in the third part. The tools used to
	be difficult to combine, especially for a large and complicated
	system with many signals and parameters such as Warp1. Now, models
	derived symbolically in one tool are easy to use in another tool for
	control design, simulation and finally implementation, as well as
	for visualization and evaluation --- thus going from equation to
	action.

	In the last part we go back to "equation" where these tools aid the
	study of balance stability when compliance is considered. It is
	shown that a legged robot in a "statically balanced" stance may
	actually be unstable. Furthermore, a criterion is derived that shows
	when a radially symmetric "statically balanced" stance on a
	compliant surface is stable. Similar analyses are performed for two
	controllers of legged robots, where it is the controller that cause
	the compliance.  },

	Walking robots have a potential to traverse certain types of terrain
	in a more efficient and stable manner than more conventional robots,
	using wheels or tracks. The property of walking robots that the
	contact with the ground is discontinuous gives them the ability to
	select footholds such that obstacles or holes are avoided. Other
	advantageous properties of walking robots are that they cause less
	damage to the terrain, active suspension is an intrinsic part of
	their structure, and they are omnidirectional, which gives them an
	advantage in maneuvering through cluttered and tight environments.

	The control of walking robots requires that the issue of stability
	against tipping over is treated in a more specific fashion than for
	wheeled robots, as there are discrete changes in the support of the
	robot when the legs are lifted or placed. The stability of the robot
	is dependent on how the legs are positioned relative to the body and
	on the sequence and timing in which the legs are lifted and
	placed. In order to reduce the risk of the robot losing stability
	while walking, a measure for the stability of the robot is typically
	used in the gait and motion planning, in order to avoid, or detect,
	that the robot could become unstable.

	The main contribution of the thesis is in the analysis of the
	stability of statically balanced quadrupedal gaits and how
	statically balanced walking can be achieved. The center of pressure,
	i.e. the point where the resultant of the ground reaction forces at
	the feet acts, is used to develop a stability measure, which is then
	used in the planning of the body motion. The stability measure is
	used to set appropriate bounds on the motion of the robot, to
	account for potentially destabilizing forces or moments. The motion
	of the robot is planned by determining the supporting force for each
	leg, which in turn will determine how the robot should shift its
	weight in order to remain statically balanced. The approach proposed
	in this thesis, therefore, solves simultaneously the problem of
	determining a statically balanced motion trajectory for the body, as
	well as, the distribution of forces to the feet, to compensate for
	the weight of the robot. A description of the implementation and
	experimental results are provided, using the quadruped robot
	WARP1. The experimental results demonstrate the walking capability
	of the robot, and its ability to handle inclined surfaces.},

    Dynamic gearing is a mechanism that has been suggested to enhance the
    performance of skeletal muscles by maintaining them at the shortening
    velocities that maximize their power efficiency.  We investigated this
    hypothesis in three domestic dogs during trotting and galloping. We used
    ground force recordings and kinematic analysis to calculate the changes in
    gear ratio that occur during the production of the external work of
    locomotion.  We also monitored length changes of the vastus lateralis
    muscle, an extensor muscle of the knee, using sonomicrometry in four
    addtional dogs to determine the nature and rate of active shortening of this
    muscle.  During both trotting and galloping, the gear ratios of the extensor
    muscles of the elbow, wrist and ankle joints were relativesly constant early
    in limb uspport.  The gear ratio at the hip exerted an extensor moment
    initially, but decreased throughout limb supporta nd became negative midway
    through support.  This pattern of decreasing gear ratio during the second
    hlaf of support indicates that dynamic rearing does not maximize muscle
    power or efficientcy at the elbow, wrist, hip and ankle joints.  In
    contrast, the extensor muscle of the shoulder and knee joints exhibited an
    increase of gear ratio during limb support. In two dogs, the vastus
    lateralis muscle shortened at a relatively constant rate of 3.7--4 lenghts
    s\textsup{-1} during intermediate speed galloping. This pattern of
    increasing gear ratio and constant velocity of muscle shortening at the knee
    joint is consistent with the hypothesis of dynamic gearing.  Given the
    amount of work done at the knee and shoulder joints of running dogs, dynamic
    gearing may contribute to the economy of constant-speed running and may be
    important to integrated limb function.

  This paper studies the force capability of a particular class of

  ability to create an external wrench onto a fixed object. The
  concept of under-actuation in robotic fingers, with fewer
  actuators than degrees of freedom (DOF) through the use of
  springs and mechanical limits, allows the hand to adjust itself
  to an irregularly shaped object without complex control strategy
  an numerous sensors.  However, in some configurations, the force
  distribution in an under-actuated finger can degenerate.  The
  finger can no longer apply forces on the object, leading in some
  cases to the ejection of the latter from the hand.  This paper
  focuses on a 2--DOF finger and studies its ability to seize
  objects with a secure grasp.  },

  The paper maily deals with the stability properties of a finger.
  If a force is applied somewhere on the phalanx what will happen
  to the finger when trying to close it. Depending on the design
  the finger will either close or open. If it opens it is bad. For
  closing two things can happen, the more near phalanx may move
  away from the object in a way that the finger slips over the
  force (bad) or the finger closes correctly and can apply
  additional force on the object.

	coaxially crossed by flexible tendons. This innovative
	design is suitable to host distributed sensory equipment

	reliability enhancement and cost reduction.
	Furthermore, the proposed solution is very flexible, as

  annote = {
    This hand have the steel flexible hinges which also acts as the extension
	mechanism, such that when tendon forces is removed the finger extends.
	The joint of the most proximal phalanx have both f/e a/a freedom. It is
	actuated by three tendons connected at 120 degrees.
	
	They find the finger hard to control by normal means and propose that
	the finger/hand should be controlled by some kind of impedance
	controller which is based on passivity. This way they don't need any
	force feedback which they claim is a cause of high complexity and low
	realiability. A drawback of the control method is that the actuator has
	to be back drivable. They consider two actuators, McKibben muscles and
	motor/ball-screw.  They choose the ballscrew solution because of better
	control precision, however the reduction needs to be large so the
	actuator is not backdrivable.  Therefore they have to introduce a force
	sensor in the actuator. 

	They note that the position of the tendon actuator is not enough for
	knowing the finger position. Further the way the flexible joints works
	makes it difficult to apply a normal angular sensor. The solution they
	found was to add flex-sensors, such often used in data gloves to measure
	the bending of human fingers. As an alternative they propose visual
	servoing.

	They also see a need for contact sensors. One of the reasons is to be
	able to know the exact contact point, in particular if there is a
	multiple of contact points). They see two possible solutions: an force
	sensitive array attached to the finger frame and a torque/force sensor
	attached to the frame. The first method was tested but the gel used for
	covering the finger distributed the force such that the information was
	less usefull. 

	My comment to this article is that the overall goal of having a very
	simple and cheap hand seem to be more and more distant. The actuators
	with internal force feedback is not such a simple device and insering
	intrisic force/torque sensors into the structure is also challenging,
	ther is not much space!

       This paper describes a method and a process for
       developing a soft artificial hand similar to a real
       human hand and its small- size- soft actuator. For the
       soft actuator, we took a pneumatic artificial muscle and
       succeeded in reducing it to a diameter of 3.5mm. The
       pneumatic artificial muscle allows the artificial hand
       not only to move softly and powerfully by pneumatic
       power but also works as a sensor. As a frame for the
       artificial hand, we used the skeleton model of human
       hand in order to make the hand similar to real human
       hand in structure as well as motion.

       Current trends in robotics are pointing to the design of dextrous
       manipulators patterned after human hands. This article reports on some
       studies of the human hand and how it relates to the design of
       anthropomorphic manipulators. We discuss hand anatomy and a mathematical
       model that relates tendon displacement to joint angle. This enables the
       understanding of the role of the tendons in normal hand function as well
       as in disability. This information may be used to design robot or hand
       prosthesis tendons after their human counterparts. We present an example
       of a shape memory alloy actuator based design. The actuators emulate
       human tendon mechanisms.

    To restore dexterity to paralyzed hands, we have designed and constructed a
    lightweight, low-profile orthotic exoskeleton controlled by the user's
    residual electromyography (EMG) signals. In this paper, we compared several
    simple strategies to control the orthotic device for a quadriplegic (C5/C6)
    subject. When contralateral arm control was employed, we found that a simple
    on/off strategy allowed for faster interaction with objects, while variable
    control provided more controlled interactions, especially with deformable
    objects. Furthermore, we designed a control strategy that allowed for a
    natural reaching and pinching sequence without the use of the contralateral
    arm. We validated that the EMG signal from the ipsilateral biceps could be
    used to develop an extremely reliable natural reaching and pinching
    algorithm. This evaluation showed that different control strategies may be
    appropriate for different situations, and further investigation on the
    natural algorithm is crucial.

    It has been pointed out that the hard structure of an EVA glove deteriorates
    efficiency of tasks in the space environment. We also found a claim that an
    EVA glove did not allow an astronaut to acquire contact information at the
    fingertips. In the study, we proposed a SkilMate Hand for space EVA gloves
    which has both a tactile media and a power assist devices. We locate
    SkilMate in a wider framework of wearable intelligent machines which assist
    in affording such working surroundings that they can exhibit their skills in
    spite of their necessity for wearing special suits typically in hazardous
    environments. The paper focuses on the development of a finger system of a
    SkilMate Hand, and begins with determination of the design guidelines
    through analyses from an interview with an astronaut. To improve the task
    efficiency, we manufacture a power assist device which compensates the
    bending moment exerted at a human finger joint utilizing an ultrasonic
    motor. We show the structure and the control strategy of the motor drives.
    To overcome the second problem of tactile insensibleness, we produce a
    tactile media device which is composed of a slip sensor element on the outer
    side and a vibrotactile display element on the inner side of a SkilMate
    Hand. Transduction characteristics of both pressure sensitive conductive
    rubber and piezo-rubber are experimentally examined in the low temperature
    region. Finally, piezo-rubber is chosen to be used as a slip sensing

   abstract ={
    Spinal cord and other local injuries often lead to partial paralysis while
    the brain stays fully functional. When this partial paralysis occurs in the
    hand, these individuals are not able to execute daily activities on their
    own even if their arms are functional. To remedy this problem, a
    lightweight, low-profile orthotic exoskeleton has been designed to restore
    dexterity to paralyzed hands. The exoskeleton\'s movements are controlled by
    the user\'s available electromyography (EMG) signals. The device has two
    actuators controlling the index finger flexion that can be used to perform a
    pinching motion against a fixed thumb. Using this orthotic device, a new
    control technique was developed to allow for a natural reaching and pinching
    sequence by utilizing the natural residual muscle activation patterns. To
    design this controller, two actuator control algorithms were explored with a
    quadriplegic (C5/C6) subject and it was determined that a simple binary
    control algorithm allowed for faster interaction with objects over a
    variable control algorithm. The binary algorithm was then used as an
    enabling algorithm to activate the exoskeleton movements when the natural
    sequence of muscle activities found a pattern related to a pinch. This
    natural pinching technique has shown significant promise toward realistic
    neural control of wearable robotic devices to assist paralyzed individuals.

  compliant joints.  A revolute and a translational compliant joint are
  proposed, both of which offer great improvements over existing flexures in the
  qualities of (1) a large range of motion, (2) minimal "axis drift," (3)
  increased off-axis stiffness, and (4) a reduced stress-concentrations.
  Analytic stiffness equations are developed for each joint and parametric
  computer models are used to verify their superior stiffness properties. A
  catalog of design charts based on the parametric models is also presented,
  allowing for rapid sizing of the joints for custom performance. A joint range
  of motion has been calculated with finite element analysis, including stress

    This report presents the entire work on the fingernail sensor, a new type of
    touch sensor for detecting contact pressure at the human fingertip. Unlike
    traditional electronic gloves, in which sensor pads are placed between the
    fingers and the environment surface, this new sensor allows the fingers to
    directly contact the environment without obstructing the humans natural
    haptic senses. The finger touch force is detected by measuring changes in
    the coloration of the fingernail; hence the sensor is mounted on the
    fingernail rather than on the fingertip.  Specifically, the fingernail is
    instrumented with miniature light emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors
    in order to measure changes in the reflection intensity when the fingertip
    is pressed against a surface. The changes in intensity are then used to
    determine changes in the blood volume under the fingernail, a technique
    termed reflectance photoplethysmography. A hemodynamic model is used to
    investigate the dynamics of the blood volume at two locations under the
    fingernail. A miniaturized prototype nail sensor is designed, built, and
    tested. The theoretical analysis is verified through experiment and
    simulation.
     
    The utility of the fingernail sensors is extended to measuring both the
    posture of human fingers and shear force at the human fingertip. Instead of
    using a traditional electronic glove with bending sensors embedded along the
    finger and shear sensors embedded beneath the fingertip, the wearable
    fingernail sensor can be used to measure the resulting changes in coloration
    of the fingernail. Since the sensor is mounted on the fingernail, finger
    posture can be measured without wearing a glove that hampers the motion of
    the fingers. Similarly, shear forces can be measured without covering the
    finger pad and obstructing the humans natural haptic sense. A new fingernail
    sensor with a two-dimensional spatial array of photodetectors is constructed
    in order to measure finger posture and shear forces. Experiments are
    performed in order to measure the outputs of the photodetectors in response
    to applied finger posture and shear forces. Analysis is then performed to
    correlate the outputs to the inputs and provide a means of distinguishing
    between normal forces, shear forces, and changes in finger posture.

    Caressing textured objects involves complex and poorly understood mechanical
    phenomena at the interface between their surfaces and the skin.
    Mechanoreceptors embedded in the skin detect its distortions and generate
    nervous signals which contribute to a representation of the apprehended
    texture.  Using a biomimetic approach, we have built a friction experiment
    to study both friction and adhesion between a novel haptic sensor and
    substrates whose texture is well controlled.  This haptic device consists of
    a MEMs based millimetric-sized force sensor, embedded in an elastomeric
    sheet mimicking the human skin. It allows us to measure locally both
    compression and shear forces a few millimeters below the sheet surface.
    
    The substrates are glass cover slides, either smooth or patterned in
    roughness using standard micro-photolithography techniques. They are put in
    contact with the haptic sensor under normal load, and pulled at constant
    velocity. The stress signals are recorded and correlated to the known
    texture.
    
    In this paper, we report results of preliminary performance tests of our
    haptic sensor.  Reproducibility is found to be good and discrimination to be
    straightforward between smooth substrates of different surface properties.
    Furthermore, this device easily detected the presence of a single step as
    well as its orientation with respect to the sense of motion. Finally, simple
    Fourier analysis allows both detection and measurement of the spatial
    periodicity of a substrate etched on a depth of about 1 m, close to the
    limit of physiological detection
