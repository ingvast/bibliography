%%% I.  	Usage of this file
%%%

This file is meant to be an archive of all the articles I (possibly
other persons too) have read. Each entry can of course be referenced
from other files, i.e. this is a bib-file. The entries could for
instance be used to generate reference lists. Another use is to find
the physcal location of the article.

An entry consists of:
'at-sign'entryType{citeKey,
   field = {},
   ...
}

When there is only one author, i construct the citeKey using the
sirname and year: Hirose84.  When there are several authors, i use the
first two letters from each name and the year: FuWa84.

An example of an entry (without the 'at'-character):

 Article{keyUsedToCiteTheArticle,
  author = 	  {},
  title = 	  {},
  journal = 	  {},
  year = 	  {},
  abstract =	  {A copy of the articles abstract},
  annote = 	  {Personal comments about the work},
  affiliation = {The responsible "group"},
  reader =	  {ChR},
  searchKey =	  {Keywords, usable for searching this file},
  location =	  "Where the article is, if it is available."
}

%%
%% Ia.	List of entry types
%%

article = An article from a journal or magazine.
book = A book with an explicit publisher.
booklet = A work that is printed and bound, but without a named
	publisher or sponsoring institution.
Conference = See InProceedings
InBook = A part of a book, which may be a chapter (or section or
	whatever) and/or a range of pages.
InCollection = A part of a book having its own title.
InProceedings = An article in a conference proceeidings.
Manual = Technical docementation.
MastersThesis = A Master's thesis.
PhdThesis = A PhD thesis.
Proceedings = The proceedings of a conference.
TechReport = A report published by a school or other institution,
	usually numbered within a series.
UnPublished = A document having an author and title, but not formally
	published.

%%
%% Ib.	List of field types.
%%

address= Usually the address of the publisher. May be ignored for
	large publishing houses.
annote = This field is ignored by the standard bibliographys. I write
	a personal comment/opinion here about the work, i.e. if it is
	useful or not.
	Personally, I use the following subfields within this field:
	Unread: <descriptive text, e.g. how much I need to read it>
	- Indicates that I haven't read the article carefully  yet.

	GenNote: <A general though or idea.>
	- Here I write down a though or idea I had while reading the
	  article

	ToDo: <Something I need to do, relating to this article>
	- Indicates that I need to get refs from it or something else.

	Reread: <Why I should read the article again>
	- Indicates that I should read the article again.

	Review: <What this has to do with my review>
	- Indicates that the article has something to with my review
	  report.

author = The name(s) of the author(s), in the format described in the
	LATEX book, i.e. "Christian and Freyr and Lennart".
booktitle = Title of a book, part of which is being cited. For book
	 entries, use the title field.

category = Here I write what kind of category I would sort this
	under. So far I am using the following categories (not all
	articles are classified, since I started with this rather
	late)

			Categories:
	- simulation
	About simulation methods. For instance algorithms to do fast
	multibody simulation.

	- control structure
	About control structures for (mostly walking) robots

	- biological gait analysis
	About analysis and models of locomotion. For instance analasysis
	to find torques and forces in joints during walking. or models
	of energy consumption.

	- neurophysiology
	Biological stuff about nervous systems etc.

	- posture stability measure
	About measures of the stability of a posture. One example is
	the stability margin measure.

	- generation of reference trajectories
	About how to generate reference trajeotories.

	- walking machine design
	About design of walking machines (robots). I mostly mean the
	mechanical design.

	- foot design
	About designing feet

chapter = A chapter (or section or whatever) number.
crossref = The database key of the entry being cross referenced.
edition = The edition of a book (example: Second). It should be an
	ordinal and the first letter capitalized.
editor = Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the LATEX
	book. If there is also an author field, then the editor field
	gives the editor of the book or collection in which the
	reference appears.
howpublished = How something strange has been published. The first
	word should be capitalized.
institution = The sponsoring institution of a technical report.
journal = A journal name. Abbreviations are provided for many journals
key = This field is used for alphabetizing, cross referencing and
	creating a label when the "author" information is
	missing. This field should not be confused with the key in the
	"\cite" command, nor the key in the beginning of a database
	entry.
month = The month in which the work was published or, for an
	unpublished work, in which it was written. You should use the
	standard abbreviation.
note = Any additional information that can help the reader. The first
	word should be capitalized.
number = The number of a journal, magazine, technical report or of a
	work in a series. An issue of a journal or magazine is usually
	identified by its volume and number; the organization that
	issues a technical report usually gives it a number; and
	sometimes books are given numbers in a named series.
organization = The organization that sponsors a conference or that
	publishes a manual.
pages = One or more page numbers or range of numbers (example: 2--11).
	A range such as 2-11 is automatically translated into 2--11,
	i.e. a double dash.
publisher = The publisher's name.
school = The name of the school where a thesis was written.
series = The name of a series or set of books. When citing an entire
	book, the title field gives its tile and an optional series
	field gives the name of a series or multi-volume set of books.
title = The work's title, typed as explained in the LATEX book.
type = The type of a technical report, example: "Research note"
volumne = The volume of a journal or multivolume book.
year = The year of a publication, or for an unpublished work, the year
	it was written.

There are also som personal field types that I have defined. These
aren't included in a standard bibliography. They are instead used to
store information about the articles.

abstract = A copy of the articles abstract.
annote = Se the field above.
affiliation = Institute/department/university/group/author who did the
	work. This could be used for tracking/finding other articles
	from the same group. The work done by Shigeo Hirsoe at Tokyo
	Institute of Technolyg, could for instance be grouped as:
	Tokyo Institute of Technolyg. There are of course lots of ways
	of grouping an article.
location = Where I have stored the paper, or if Freyr of Lennart has
	it. The entry might indicate a series of folders, instead of a
	single folder. For instance, "American Papers" could actually
	refer to "American Papers I" through "American Papers III", if
	the series consists fo three folders. In this case, the first
	volume should contain information about in which volume the
	paper can be found.
reader = Who has read the article, if others (Freyr or Lennart) add
	entries to this file.
searchKey = Keywords that characterize the content of the article. I
	haven't defined any standard keywords yet.
